1. Shipbuilding  sophisticated  sailors 
	Shipbuilding today is based on science and ships are built using computers and sophisticated tools. The Romans were not traditionally sailors but mostly land-based people, who learned to build ships from the people that they conquered, namely the Greeks and the Egyptians.


2. surviving  sails  rigging  hull  Planks  sewn  
	There are a few surviving written documents that give descriptions and representations of ancient Roman ships, including the sails and rigging. Studies of these have taught us that ancient Roman shipbuilders built the outer hull first, then proceeded with the frame and the rest of the ship. Planks used to build the outer hull were initially sewn together. 

3. whereby  stitching  systematic  unequalled
	Starting from the 6th century BCE, they were fixed using a method called mortise and tenon, whereby one plank locked into another without the need for stitching. This method was more systematic and dramatically shortened ship construction times. The ancient Romans built large merchant ships and warships whose size and technology were unequalled until the 16th century CE.


4. lightweight  speedy  coast  ballast  crippled  naval  bronze battering ram  oars  navy
	Warships were built to be lightweight and very speedy. They had to be able to sail near the coast which is why they had no ballast or excess load and were built with a long, narrow hull. They did not sink when damaged and often would lie crippled on the sea’s surface following naval battles. They had a bronze battering ram, which was used to pierce the timber hulls or break the oars of enemy vessels. Eventually, Rome’s navy became the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean.


5. rowers  contrary  enrolled  superseded
	It had rowers in the top, middle and lower levels, and approximately 50 rowers in each bank. The rowers at the bottom had the most uncomfortable position as they were under the other rowers. It is worth noting that contrary to popular perception, rowers were not slaves but mostly Roman citizens enrolled in the military. The trireme was superseded by larger ships with even more rowers.


6. rudders  stern  tiller  cables  masts  square  coordinating
	They usually had two huge side rudders located off the stern and controlled by a small tiller bar connected to a system of cables. They had from one to three masts with large square sails and a small triangular sail at the bow. Just like warships, merchant ships used oarsmen, but coordinating the hundreds of rowers in both types of ship was not an easy task.


7. bars, copper, marble  granite  towboats  drag  quay
	The cargo on merchant ships included raw materials (e.g. iron bars, copper, marble and granite), and agricultural products. Large merchant ships would approach the destination port and, just like today, be intercepted by a number of towboats that would drag them to the quay.


8. Navigation  facilitated
	Navigation in ancient Rome did not rely on sophisticated instruments such as compasses but on experience, local knowledge and observation of natural phenomena. In conditions of good visibility, seamen in the Mediterranean often had the mainland or islands in sight, which greatly facilitated navigation. 


9. succession  recognisable  mariners  swell  superficial  expedition  afloat
	They sailed by noting their position relative to a succession of recognisable landmarks. When weather conditions were not good or where land was no longer visible, Roman mariners estimated directions from the pole star or, with less accuracy, from the Sun at noon. They also estimated directions relative to the wind and swell.
