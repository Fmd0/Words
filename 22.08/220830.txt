2. brute 最基本的 粗野的人  violent 残暴的
	Except for the naive brute-force algorithm, which we review in Section 32.1, each string-matching algorithm in this chapter performs some preprocessing based on the pattern and then finds all valid shifts; we call this latter phase “matching.”


3.  generalize 推广  generate 产生
	It also generalizes nicely to other pattern-matching problems. 


4. notation 标记(词根note)  notion 概念  terminology 专业术语
