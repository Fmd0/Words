1.  intuitively
	The “flow” of the material at any point in the system is intuitively the rate at which the material moves.


2. conduit 管道
	We can think of each directed edge in a flow network as a conduit for the material.


3. junction 会合处
	Vertices are conduit junctions, and other than the source and sink, material flows through the vertices without collecting in them. 


4.  property
	We call this property “flow conservation,” and it is equivalent to Kirchhoff’s current law when the material is electrical current.


5. violate 违反  violent 暴力的  violence  暴力
	In the maximum-flow problem, we wish to compute the greatest rate at which we can ship material from the source to the sink without violating any capacity constraints.


6. adapt 调整...以适应 适应  
	Moreover, we can adapt the basic techniques used in maximum-flow algorithms to solve other network-flow problems.


7.  formalizes 正式确定 (词根 form) formal 形式的 正式的
	Section 26.1 formalizes the notions of flow networks and flows, formally defining the maximum-flow problem. 


8. properties  notation
	In this section, we give a graph-theoretic definition of flow networks, discuss their properties, and define the maximum-flow problem precisely. We also introduce some helpful notation.


9. significant 重要的 意义重大的 (词根 signify 表示 意味)
	We include it, however, because when we introduce residual networks later in this chapter, the flow into the source will become significant.
