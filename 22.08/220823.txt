1.  throttle 节流
	The TCP congestion-control mechanism throttles a sending process (client or server) when the network is congested between sender and receiver. 


2. involve 需要 联系  英译 某种情形或重大事件包括了something作为必要的组成部分或结果
	Indeed, many of today’s network applications involve communication between client and server programs that have been created by independent developer.


3. proprietary 专有的 proprietor 所有者  property 财产  英译 属于某人的东西
	The other type of network application is a proprietary network application. In this case, the client and server programs employ an application-layer protocol that has not been openly published in an RFC or elsewhere. 


4. conversely 相反的  converse 相反之物 交谈  contract  contrast 差异 反面
	Recall also that when a client or server program implements a protocol defined by an RFC, it should use the well-known port number associated with the protocol; conversely, when developing a proprietary application, the developer must be careful to avoid using such well-known port numbers. 


5. demonstrate 示范操作
	We’ll use the following simple client-server application to demonstrate socket programming for both UDP and TCP:


6. auxiliary 辅助的
	“Good code” would certainly have a few more auxiliary lines, in particular for handling error cases. For this application, we have arbitrarily chosen 12000 for the server port number.
