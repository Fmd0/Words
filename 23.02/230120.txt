Way back in Section 1.6, we described some of the more prevalent and damaging classes of Internet attacks,


This being a networking text, we should remark that Alice and Bob could be two routers that want to exchange routing tables securely, a client and server that want to establish a secure transport connection, or two e-mail applications that want to exchange secure e-mail—all case studies that we will consider later in this chapter. 


Love affairs, wartime communication, and business transactions are the commonly cited human needs for secure communications; preferring the first to the latter two, we’re happy to use Alice and Bob as our sender and receiver, and imagine them in this first scenario.


As we will see, security (like love) is a manysplendored thing; that is, there are many facets to security. 


and that if their communication is tampered with by an eavesdropper, that this tampering is detected.


we’ll cover the fundamental cryptography techniques that allow for encrypting communication, authenticating the party with whom one is communicating, and ensuring message integrity.


We’ll examine how to secure e-mail, how to secure a TCP connection, how to provide blanket security at the net- work layer, and how to secure a wireless LAN. 


 In particular, we’ll take a careful look at how firewalls and intrusion detection systems can enhance the security of an organizational network.



What precisely does this mean?


The HTTP specification defines that all requests are issued with a method, which normally indicates what action the client is asking the server to perform. 


This is an extremely useful object that contains all the information that the client included in the HTTP request. Table 2-2 enumerates the most commonly used attributes and methods of the Flask request object.
