1. decouple 分离 解耦   reasonably 合理地 明智地
	This approach has the advantage that it would decouple the implementation of the standard functions from the implementation of the compiler, and would still be reasonably convenient for programmers. 


2. prone 容易...的 有...倾向的
	However, this approach would require application programmers to explicitly link the appropriate object modules into their executables, a process that would be error prone and time consuming:


3. disk 圆盘 硬盘   reference 提及 引用 参考
	At link time, the linker will only copy the object modules that are referenced by the program, which reduces the size of the executable on disk and in memory. 


4. archive 档案 归档
	An archive is a collection of concatenated relocatable object files, with a header that describes the size and location of each member object file.
