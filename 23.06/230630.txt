	The rise of dictionaries is associated with the rise of the English middle class, who were anxious to define and circumscribe the various worlds to conquer — lexical as well as social and commercial.

	Johnson was a poet and critic who raised common sense to the heights of genius.


5. academy 名 研究院  sign the contract 签合同  instalment 名 一期付款
	Up until his time, the task of producing a dictionary on such a large scale had seemed impossible without the establishment of an academy to make decisions about right and wrong usage. Johnson decided he did not need an academy to settle arguments about language; he would write a dictionary himself and he would do it single-handed. Johnson signed the contract for the Dictionary with the bookseller Robert Dosley at a breakfast held at the Golden Anchor Inn near Holbom Bar on 18 June 1764. He was to be paid ￡1,5 in instalments, and from this he took money to rent Gough Square, in which he set up his ‘dictionary workshop’.

13. esteem 动 尊重  pension 名 养老金  folklore 名 民俗学  lore 名 学问
	The Dictionary, together with his other writing, made Johnson famous and so well esteemed that his friends were able to prevail upon King George Ⅲ to offer him a pension. From then on, he was to become the Johnson of folklore.
