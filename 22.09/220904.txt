1. /*amortize*/ 分期偿还 平摊  efficient  sufficient  effect
	The array pi allows us to compute the transition function F efficiently (in an amortized sense) “on the fly” as needed. 


2. loosely speaking 一般来说 大致来说
	Loosely speaking, for any state q = 0, 1,..., m and any character a 属于字母集,the value pi[q] contains the information we need to compute F(q,a) but that does not depend on a.


3. encapsulate 概括 包含 封装  capsule 胶囊
	The prefix function pi for a pattern encapsulates knowledge about how the pattern matches against shifts of itself. 


4. tantamount 无异于 等价的
	Since s'+k = s+q ,if we are given s and q, then finding the smallest shift s0 is tantamount to finding the longest prefix length k.
